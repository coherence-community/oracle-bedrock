<h4>Overview</h4>

The [Oracle Tools][ORACLETOOLS] project consists of a collection of runtime developer
tools, typically used for managing multiple application processes as part of developer
written functional and integration tests.

While developed in Java the tools may be used for managing non-Java-based
applications.

[Oracle Tools][ORACLETOOLS] provides a layer of abstraction over the usual runtime
process management libraries, for example, those provided in core Java,
the goal being to simplify the development and management of cross-platform and
multi-process systems, especially those required for distributed application testing.

For the most part the [Oracle Tools][ORACLETOOLS] project was spawned from earlier
work on process management in the [Oracle Coherence Incubator][COHINC],
that specifically focused simplifying the development of functional tests for
[Oracle Coherence][COH] clusters and cluster-based applications.

In recent years however it became clear that such functionality was useful outside
the scope of the [Oracle Coherence Incubator][COHINC], especially for managing
non-[Oracle Coherence][COH] based applications, and hence the core features were
refactored and sanitized to produce the [Oracle Tools][ORACLETOOLS] project, that
of which is now free of [Oracle Coherence][COH] and other proprietary product
dependencies.

> Although the Oracle Tools project does include an [Oracle Coherence][COH]
> specific module for use with [Oracle Coherence][COH], this is module optional and
> does not reduce the functionality or features of [Oracle Tools][ORACLETOOLS].

<h4>Recommended Reading</h4>

To get started with [Oracle Tools][ORACLETOOLS] we recommend you read the following:

*   [An Introduction to Deferred References](core/deferreds.html).

    The concept of a Deferred Reference is central to large parts of the
    Oracle Tools project.  Understanding their definition, use and adoption
    will dramatically improve the your ability to use Oracle Tools and the
    benefits it provides.

*   [An Introduction to Application Management](runtime/applications.html).

    The Oracle Tools project provides an expressive mechanism for starting,
    stopping, isolating, monitoring and managing application processes at
    runtime from other applications.

    Understanding how to use these features can dramatically simplify the
    process of developing concurrent and distributed applications tests,
    across platforms in an operating-system independent manner, without
    the need for scripting.

*   [Using Oracle Tools with Coherence-based Applications](coherence/index.html).

    The Coherence Module for Oracle Tools provides several extensions to the
    out-of-the-box tools for managing applications at runtime.  These
    extensions makes it effortless to develop unit and integration tests for
    Coherence-based applications, including establishing and tearing down clusters
    both in-process (container-mode) and natively (using local processes).
