/**
 * A specialized {@link Deferred} implementation that attempts to guarantee a
 * an object reference will be returned when a call to {@link Ensured#get()} is
 * made.  ie: "ensuring that an object is available".
 * <p>
 * An {@link Ensured} will repetitively attempt to acquire a object reference,
 * including <code>null</code> from an underlying {@link Deferred},
 * giving up only after the timeout conditions are met, an unexpected exception
 * or {@link PermanentlyUnavailableException} occurs.
 * <p>
 * The timeout constraints are defined through the use of the following {@link Option}s,
 * Maximum Retry {@link Timeout}, Initially {@link InitialDelay} By, {@link MaximumRetryDelay}
 * and the {@link RetryFrequency}.  When none are specified, default are auto-detected
 * from the current environment and configuration.
 * <p>
 * If an object reference or <code>null</code> can not be acquired with in the
 * specified constraints, a {@link PermanentlyUnavailableException} will be thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the underlying {@link Deferred} throws an {@link PermanentlyUnavailableException},
 * while attempting to acquire the object reference, the said exception will be
 * immediately rethrown.
 * <p>
 * The default behavior of {@link #get()} is to attempt to acquire the
 * underlying resource from the specified {@link Deferred}, retrying a number
 * of times, waiting for at most the maximum {@link Timeout} duration.   The delay
 * between subsequent failures and corresponding retries is specified by an
 * {@link Iterator}, defined by the {@link RetryFrequency}.   An initial delay
 * defined by the {@link InitialDelay} {@link Option} will be applied if specified, and
 * subsequent delays between retries will not be any larger than the specified
 * {@link MaximumRetryDelay}.
