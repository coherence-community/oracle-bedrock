Oracle Bedrock
==============

Oracle Bedrock provides a general purpose Java framework for the development, orchestration and testing of highly concurrent distributed applications.

It's often used for orchestrating and testing multi-server, multi-process distributed applications, meaning it's
especially useful for working with Coherence-based applications.  However it can be used for any type of application or server, Java or not.

Oracle Bedrock provides extremely uniform mechanisms to start/stop and manage applications and processes on a variety of platforms, including;

* Local Platforms
* Remote Platforms (via ssh, powershell et al)
* Virtualized Platforms (via Vagrant), including machine / platform orchestration (VirtualBox, VMWare etc)
* Containerized Platforms (via Docker), including image management
* Java Virtual Machines (aka: in-process applications)

Which means it can orchestrate launching applications/servers in any environment, locally, on-premise, across data-centers or in one or more clouds.

For example:  To Launch a "HelloWorld" Java Application on the current classpath on the LocalPlatform, use the following:

```
    LocalPlatform platform = LocalPlatform.get();

    try (JavaApplication application = platform.launch(JavaApplication.class,
                                                       ClassName.of(HelloWorld.class))) {

        // potentially do something with the application ...

        // wait until it finishes execution
        application.waitFor();
    }
```

To launch this application on another platform, simply change the platform.   The rest of the code remains the same.

```
    // launch using a RemotePlatform
    RemotePlatform platform = new RemotePlatform(address, username, authentication);

    // ... or launch inside the running JavaVirtualMachine Platform (ie: in-process)
    JavaVirtualMachine platform = JavaVirtualMachine.get();
```

For Java-based applications, Oracle Bedrock uniquely provides support for:

* Packaging and automatically deploying applications (based on a ClassPath or Maven Dependency POM)
* Dynamically interacting with applications at runtime, without requiring technologies like RMI, including the ability to dynamically execute lambdas / remote callables / runnables through an ExecutorService like interface.

```
    // execute the lambda in the java application, where ever it is running!
    application.submit(() -> { System.out.println("Hello World");});

    // request a lambda to execute (in the java application) and return a result (as a CompleteableFuture)
    CompletableFuture<String> property = application.submit(() -> System.getProperty("os.name"));
```

Lastly, Oracle Bedrock provides a powerful extension to testing tools, allow developers to Eventually assert that
conditions in concurrent data-structures and distributed applications are reached.

```
   // ensure that the application internal state reaches some condition
   Eventually.assertThat(application, () -> { someFunction() }, is(someValue));
```

## Building

Bedrock is a Maven project and can be built with standard Maven commands.

### Prerequisites

1. The Coherence modules have a dependency on four versions of Coherence. The exact versions can be found in the `coherence.version` property in `pom.xml` files
 
    [bedrock-coherence/3.7.1/pom.xml](./bedrock-coherence/3.7.1/pom.xml)  
    [bedrock-coherence/12.1.2/pom.xml](./bedrock-coherence/12.1.2/pom.xml)  
    [bedrock-coherence/12.1.3/pom.xml](./bedrock-coherence/12.1.3/pom.xml)  
    [bedrock-coherence/12.2.1/pom.xml](./bedrock-coherence/12.2.1/pom.xml)  
    
    As Coherence is not available in public Maven repos the `coherence.jar` files for each of those versions needs to be loaded to your own local or remote Maven repository under the groupId `com.oracle.coherence` and artifactId `coherence`.

2. There are a number of tests in the `bedrock-runtime-remote-tests` module that will attempt to SSH into your local machine using private/public key pair. For this to work you need a key pair configured.

    1. By default the private key file is called `127.0.0.1_dsa` and corresponding public key `127.0.0.1_dsa.pub`. You can run the build with a system property to change this to any valid key that you already have configured for ssh'ing into your machine: For example to use `id_rsa` then add `-Dbedrock.remote.privatekey.file=~/.ssh/id_rsa` to the Maven command line.
    
    2. Alternatively you may need to generate a new key pair using `ssh-keygen`. **NOTE** ensure that they type of key-pair generated is a valid type to SSH into your machine. For example on MacOS an RSA key pair will be fine, a DSA key pair may not, so even though the default file name used in tests has the suffix `_dsa` it can contain any type of key.
    
        ```
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -f 127.0.0.1_dsa
        ```   
  
        **Do not** set a passphrase for the keys. 
        
    3. Add the public key to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
    
        ```
        cat ~/.ssh/127.0.0.1_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        ```   
    
    4. Restart your SSH daemon to pick up the change to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. On MacOS run
        ```
        sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd
        sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd
        ```

    5. Test that you can ssh into your own machine with the new key
        ```
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/foo_rsa <your-user-name>@127.0.0.1
        ```
    
:warning: **WARNING**
Any keys used for testing and building should be used with care.
If the private key is disclosed, any observer will be able to log into the user's machine.
Users should delete the key from authorized_keys as soon as the tests are complete.

### Run the build
To run a full build:
```
mvn clean install
```
To run a full build without tests:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
